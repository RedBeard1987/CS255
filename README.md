Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  Liam is the owner of DriverPass. Liam wants a web based system that can help train new drivers not only for the Department of Motor Vehichles written test but also for real world driving applications too. He wants to have an online website where customers can register, login, and purchase different driving packages. He also wants to be consistant with up to date information from the DMV.
  
What did you do particularly well?

I feel that my diagrams were done quite well but everything could be modified to be better. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

My project two design document could have been a bit more in depth to coinside with my non-technical presentation that also could have used a more thoroughness of the DriverPass system. I tried to keep my bias opinion out of my context and only apply broad facts to the presentation. I maintained non-technical jargon for the presentees sake. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I followed the initial interview transcript that was provided. The owner of the DriverPass system came for a service, they have a great idea of what they want and that is the key to making them happy is to listen and only advise necessity changes should the tasks be outside the realm of reality. The clients have the vision we are just trying to bring those visions to reality.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing code, I try and keep my code simple and break it up into smaller functionalities. Keeping code indepenent from other functions makes it more efficient and reuseable and integratable.
